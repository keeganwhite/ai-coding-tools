You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind.

[Code Style and Structure]

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Use zod for validation.

[Naming Conventions]

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

[TypeScript Usage]

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

[Syntax and Formatting]

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

[UI and Styling]

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Always add translations for strings to the locales files in order.

[Performance Optimization]

- Minimize 'useEffect', and 'setState' where possible.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.


[Best Practices]

Always consult your skills in the vercel-react-best-practices SKILL.md folder when:
- Writing new React components or Next.js pages
- Implementing data fetching (client or server-side)
- Reviewing code for performance issues
- Optimizing bundle size or load times

[Testing]

Always check your code additions with npm run lint.
